## Credit Card Churn

The following machine learning model was developed to predict the likelihood of credit card churn, using existing client data.

The entire project was developed following some predetermined guidelines, listed below:

1. **Data Acquisition:** It was from two sources, but with datasets of the same size;
2. **Extract, Transform and Load (ETL):** Data integration, cleaning, rescaling, pattern recognition;
3. **Relevant Variables:** Sex, gender, salary, bank score;
4. **Data Analysis:** Type of data (categorical or numeric), statistical analysis, outliers, normalization;
5. **Machine Learning Models:** Clustering, classification, regression, decision trees.

This guideline is important to the data treatment pipeline. In this case, the focus isn't on solving the churn problem, but on identifying possible clients who might churn their credit cards.

## Color Palette
Below are the colors selected for this project:

## 1 - Data acquisition:
Data acquisition was from Kaggle, using the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandshaw2001/customer-churn-dataset

All used data was saved at the same path on the computer.

## 2 - Extract, Transform and Load:
To import the data, I used the `pandas` library with this simple structure of it: `.read_csv('path')`.
So, here is how the code looks:

```
#Reading the CSV archives
df1 = pd.read_csv('../Dados/Customer-Churn-Records1.csv', delimiter=";")
df2 = pd.read_csv('../Dados/Customer-Churn-Records2.csv', delimiter=";")
df3 = pd.read_csv('../Dados/Customer-Churn-Records3.csv', delimiter=";")
```
```python
# Este é um bloco de código Python
print("Hello, World!")
```
